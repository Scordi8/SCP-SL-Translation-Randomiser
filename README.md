# SCPSL_Translation_Randomiser
Script to apply random rich text formatting to SCP: Secret Laboratory translation files.

# How to use

step 1: Run the script. You can do this by downloading the code and running it, or by the exe provided in releases.

step 2: Click Select Source folder, and choose your translation folder, located in the SCP: SL game files. This should be a specific translation folder such as "English (Default)", not the root translation folder.

step 3: Select a colour mode. Default is None, double click Random or Cycle to change to respective modes. Random provides a random colour per character, where Cycle provides a colour variation, increasing per character. *It is important that your selected choice is show with an underline, or else it will not be used!*

step 4: (optional) change the setting for the Cycle mode using the 'Cycle mode options' button. The opened window allows you th change the rate the colour changes (step, default = 2, minimum = 1, reccommended value between 1 and 10, no hard limit), the Saturation, and the value of the colour. [HSV colour space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV).

step 5: Choose what you want to randomise by selecting the checkboxes.

step 6: Name your translation folder, it's important this field contains only standard folder characters (use alphanumeric characters only).

step 7: Click generate

step 8: Run SCP: SL.

step 9: In SCP: SL, under settings/other, change the translations to the folder name you decided prior.

**If the new translations comes up red in the translations list, it will still work. It is simply missing the optional manifest.json file**
